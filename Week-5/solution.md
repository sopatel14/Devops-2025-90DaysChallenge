Task 1: Jenkins Pipeline Job for CI/CD

Jenkinsfile
groovy
pipeline {
    agent any  // This means the pipeline can run on any available Jenkins agent (machine)

    stages {   // The pipeline is divided into multiple stages

        stage('Clone Code') {   // Stage 1: Download the code from GitHub
            steps {
                echo 'Cloning repository...'
                // 'git' command will pull the code from GitHub main branch
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/sopatel14/flask-app-ecs.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build Docker Image') {   // Stage 2: Build Docker image using Dockerfile
            steps {
                echo 'Building Docker image...'
                // The following command builds a Docker image named "flask-app"
                sh 'docker build -t flask-app .'
            }
        }

        stage('Run Container') {   // Stage 3: Run the app inside a Docker container
            steps {
                echo 'Running container...'
                sh '''
                # Stop and remove old container if it already exists
                docker stop flask-container || true
                docker rm flask-container || true

                # Run new container from the image we just built
                # -d = detached mode (run in background)
                # -p 5000:80 = map port 5000 of host to port 80 inside container
                # --name = give container a name "flask-container"
                docker run -d -p 5000:80 --name flask-container flask-app
                '''
            }
        }

        stage('Test App') {   // Stage 4: Check if app is running properly
            steps {
                echo 'Testing application...'
                sh '''
                # Wait a few seconds for the app to start
                sleep 5

                # Use curl to check if the app responds on localhost:5000
                # -f = fail if HTTP status is not 200
                # If test fails, exit with code 1 (to mark build as failed)
                curl -f http://localhost:5000 || exit 1
                '''
            }
        }
    }
}

Pipeline Execution Results
The pipeline execution showed the following stages:

Clone Code: Successfully cloned the repository from GitHub

Build Docker Image: Successfully built the Docker image with all dependencies

Run Container: Container started successfully

Test App: FAILED - The application was not accessible on port 5000

Issues Encountered and Resolution
Problem: The test stage failed because the Flask application inside the container was not accessible on localhost:5000.

Root Cause: The container was running but the application might have been:

Listening on a different port inside the container

Not starting properly

Having internal configuration issues

Evidence from Logs:

text
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                   PORTS                                               NAMES
e3737f5018d7   flask-sample-app:latest   "python run.py"          11 seconds ago   Up 8 seconds             80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp, :::5000->5000/tcp   testapp
The container shows port 5000 mapped correctly, but the application wasn't responding.

Resolution Steps:

Check the application logs inside the container

Verify the Flask app is configured to listen on the correct host and port

Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

Test the container locally before running in pipeline

Interview Questions
1. How do declarative pipelines streamline the CI/CD process compared to scripted pipelines?
Declarative pipelines provide a more structured and simplified approach to CI/CD by:

Using a predefined structure with pipeline, stages, and steps blocks

Built-in syntax validation that catches errors early

Easier readability and maintainability

Native support for common CI/CD patterns

Better integration with Blue Ocean visualization

Simplified error handling and post actions

Scripted pipelines offer more flexibility but require deeper Groovy knowledge and can become complex for simple workflows.

2. What are the benefits of breaking the pipeline into distinct stages?
Visibility and Monitoring:

Clear progress tracking through each stage

Easy identification of where failures occur

Better dashboard visualization

Efficiency:

Parallel execution of independent stages

Early failure detection saves time and resources

Conditional stage execution based on needs

Maintenance:

Modular structure makes debugging easier

Teams can own specific stages

Reusable stage components

Quality Control:

Each stage can have specific quality gates

Progressive validation of the build

Clear separation of concerns (build vs test vs deploy)

Key Learnings
Container Port Mapping: Understanding how Docker port mapping works is crucial for successful deployment

Application Configuration: The application inside the container must be properly configured to accept external connections

Pipeline Debugging: Jenkins provides detailed logs that help identify exactly where and why failures occur

Incremental Testing: Testing each stage independently helps catch issues early in the process

The pipeline successfully demonstrated the CI/CD concept, with the test failure highlighting the importance of proper application configuration and container networking setup.

üîß Pipeline Setup Steps
1. Multi-Branch Pipeline Configuration
Created two Multibranch Pipeline jobs in Jenkins:

backend-flask ‚Üí Points to https://github.com/sopatel14/flask-backend.git

frontend-repo ‚Üí Points to https://github.com/sopatel14/flask-frontend.git

Configured branch sources with Git repository URLs

Set scan triggers to automatically detect new branches

Configured Script Path as Jenkinsfile for each repository

2. Branch Strategy Implementation
Main Branch: Production-ready code with automatic builds

Feature Branches: Automatically detected and built (e.g., feature/user-auth)

Development Branch: develop for integration testing

3. Main Controller Setup
Created Pipeline job (not multibranch) named microservices-main

Used the provided Jenkinsfile to trigger both services in parallel

Configured to run on any available agent

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered and Solutions
Issue	Root Cause	Solution
No item named backend-flask/main found	Jenkins job naming mismatch	Verified exact job names in Jenkins dashboard
Port conflicts during deployment	Previous containers not cleaned up	Added cleanup commands: `docker stop		true`
Parallel execution timing	Services starting in wrong order	Used independent deployment with service discovery
Build resource contention	Multiple Docker builds simultaneously	Implemented resource allocation in production setup

2. Service Isolation
Each microservice has independent pipeline

Separate build, test, and deployment stages

Individual rollback capability

3. Branch Management
Automatic branch discovery

Feature branch testing before merge

Pull request validation

üìù Interview Questions & Answers
Q1: How does a multi-branch pipeline improve continuous integration for microservices?
Answer:
Multi-branch pipelines significantly enhance CI for microservices by:

Automatic Branch Management: Automatically discovers and builds new branches and pull requests without manual configuration

Isolated Testing: Each feature branch gets its own isolated pipeline, preventing conflicts between different development efforts

Parallel Development: Multiple teams can work on different microservices simultaneously without blocking each other

Quality Gates: Every branch undergoes the same rigorous testing process before merging to main

Visual Progress: Clear visibility into which branches are building, testing, and ready for deployment

Independent Deployment: Services can be deployed separately, enabling canary releases and blue-green deployments

Q2: What challenges might you face when merging feature branches in a multi-branch pipeline?
Answer:
Common challenges and mitigation strategies:

Integration Conflicts:

Challenge: Different feature branches might introduce incompatible API changes between microservices

Solution: Implement contract testing and API versioning strategies

Environment Inconsistency:

Challenge: Feature branches might require different environment configurations or dependencies

Solution: Use containerization and infrastructure-as-code for consistent environments across branches

Database Schema Migration:

Challenge: Conflicting database migrations across feature branches

Solution: Implement backward-compatible schema changes and feature toggles

Resource Contention:

Challenge: Multiple parallel builds can strain build resources and test environments

Solution: Implement build resource optimization and parallel test execution strategies

Dependency Management:

Challenge: Different branches might depend on different versions of shared libraries or services

Solution: Use semantic versioning and dependency isolation techniques

Testing Complexity:

Challenge: Ensuring comprehensive integration testing across all microservice combinations

Solution: Implement consumer-driven contract tests and comprehensive integration testing suites

‚úÖ Key Learnings & Best Practices
Clear Job Naming: Consistent naming conventions prevent reference errors

Proper Cleanup: Always include container cleanup in deployment stages

Error Handling: Use || true for non-critical failures in shell commands

Resource Management: Monitor system resources during parallel builds

Service Discovery: Implement proper service discovery for microservice communication

üöÄ Production Recommendations
Add Monitoring: Integrate with monitoring tools for build metrics

Security Scanning: Add security scanning stages in each pipeline

Performance Testing: Include performance testing before production deployment

Rollback Strategies: Implement automated rollback mechanisms

Environment Promotion: Add staging and production environment stages

The multi-branch pipeline approach successfully demonstrated efficient microservice management with parallel execution, independent deployment, and comprehensive branch management capabilities.

Task 3: Configure and Scale Jenkins Agents/Nodes
üß© Scenario

As the build workload increases, Jenkins needs multiple agents to distribute tasks efficiently. In this setup, I configured one Linux-based agent and planned for additional agents (Windows or another Linux) for future scaling once resources allow.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Setup and Connection
üîπ Jenkins Master

OS: Kali Linux

Role: Controller (manages jobs, triggers builds)

Tools Installed: Jenkins, Git, SSH, Docker client (optional)

üîπ Jenkins Agent

OS: Ubuntu (EC2 instance on AWS)

Purpose: Executes builds and deployments

Tools Installed:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker


Verification:

docker ps

üîπ SSH Configuration

Generated key on Jenkins master:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "jenkins-agent"


Copied the public key to the EC2 instance:

echo "<public-key>" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


Tested connection:

ssh ubuntu@<EC2-IP>


‚úÖ Successful SSH login confirmed secure communication between master and agent.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Jenkins Agent Configuration in UI

Path:
Manage Jenkins ‚Üí Nodes ‚Üí New Node ‚Üí Permanent Agent

Settings:

Node Name: dev

Remote Root Directory: /home/ubuntu/jenkins

Labels: dev linux

Executors: 1

Launch Method: SSH

Host: <EC2-IP>

Credentials:

Username: ubuntu

Private key: (Master‚Äôs private key pasted here)

Host Key Verification: Non-verifying

‚úÖ After saving, the node showed ‚ÄúConnected‚Äù, confirming successful agent setup.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Jenkinsfile Configuration

Key Idea: The pipeline runs on the EC2 Linux agent labeled dev.
It performs build, security scan, Docker image push, and deployment steps sequentially.

@Library("Shared") _
pipeline {
    agent { label "dev" }

    stages {
        stage("Code Clone") {
            steps {
                script {
                    clone("https://github.com/sopatel14/two-tier-flask-app.git", "master")
                }
            }
        }

        stage("Trivy File System Scan") {
            steps {
                script {
                    trivy_fs()
                }
            }
        }

        stage("Build") {
            steps {
                sh "docker build -t two-tier-flask-app ."
            }
        }

        stage("Push to Docker Hub") {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker_push("dockerHubCreds", "two-tier-flask-app")
                }
            }
        }

        stage("Deploy") {
            steps {
                dir("${WORKSPACE}") {
                    echo "üõ†Ô∏è Deploying Flask + MySQL..."
                    sh "docker compose down || true"
                    sh "docker compose pull flask-app || true"
                    sh "docker compose up -d --build"
                    sh "docker ps"
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            emailext(
                subject: "‚úÖ Build successful",
                body: "Build and deployment succeeded.",
                to: 'souravpatel65@gmail.com'
            )
        }
        failure {
            emailext(
                subject: "‚ùå Build failed",
                body: "Check Jenkins logs for details.",
                to: 'souravpatel65@gmail.com'
            )
        }
    }
}


‚úÖ All stages executed on the Linux agent (label: dev) successfully.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Verification

From Jenkins dashboard:
‚úÖ Agent status: Connected (green)
‚úÖ Build logs: Showed Running on dev in /home/ubuntu/jenkins/workspace/...
‚úÖ Docker containers: Both Flask and MySQL deployed and running on EC2 agent.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Parallel and Future Scaling (Planned)

Due to limited resources, only one agent (Linux) was configured.
However, scaling can be done by adding:

Windows agent (for .NET or PowerShell tasks)

Additional Linux agent (for Docker-heavy builds)
Using labels, stages can be split:

stage("Build on Linux") {
    agent { label "linux" }
    steps { sh "docker build -t app ." }
}
stage("Test on Windows") {
    agent { label "windows" }
    steps { bat "run-tests.bat" }
}

6Ô∏è‚É£ Benefits of Distributed Builds

‚úÖ Speed: Multiple agents allow parallel job execution, reducing total build time.
‚úÖ Reliability: If one agent goes down, others continue processing builds.
‚úÖ Flexibility: Different OS agents can handle platform-specific tasks.
‚úÖ Scalability: Jenkins can easily scale horizontally by adding new nodes.

‚úÖ Summary
Component	Role	Status
Jenkins Master	Control node (Kali)	‚úÖ Running
Jenkins Agent	Build node (Ubuntu EC2)	‚úÖ Connected
Connection	SSH with key pair	‚úÖ Verified
Jenkinsfile	Runs full CI/CD pipeline	‚úÖ Working
Next Step	Add Windows agent for parallel jobs	üîú Planned







Task 4: Implement and Test RBAC in a Multi-Team Environment
üöÄ RBAC Implementation Overview
User Roles Created
Based on the matrix security configuration, I successfully implemented three distinct user roles:

Admin User - Full system access

Tester User - Limited to testing-related permissions

Developer User - Build and development permissions

üîß RBAC Configuration Details
1. Matrix-Based Security Setup
Global Permissions Configuration:

Permission Category	Admin	Tester	Developer
Overall	‚úÖ Full	‚ö†Ô∏è Limited	‚ö†Ô∏è Limited
Credentials	‚úÖ Manage	‚ùå None	‚ùå None
Agent	‚úÖ Configure	‚úÖ Build	‚úÖ Build
Job	‚úÖ Create/Build	‚úÖ Build	‚úÖ Build
View	‚úÖ Configure	‚úÖ Read	‚úÖ Read
2. Role-Based Access Control Strategy
Admin Role:

Full system administration privileges

Can manage users, credentials, and system configuration

Complete access to all jobs and agents

Tester Role:

Permission to execute builds and tests

Access to view test results and logs

Cannot modify pipeline configuration or credentials

Developer Role:

Ability to trigger builds and view results

Access to development-related jobs

Restricted from production deployments and sensitive credentials

‚úÖ Verification Steps
1. User Access Testing
Admin User Verification:

‚úÖ Can access Jenkins system configuration

‚úÖ Can manage users and credentials

‚úÖ Can create and modify jobs

‚úÖ Can configure agents and plugins

Tester User Verification:

‚úÖ Can execute test jobs

‚úÖ Can view test results and build logs

‚ùå Cannot modify job configuration

‚ùå Cannot access credential management

Developer User Verification:

‚úÖ Can trigger development builds

‚úÖ Can view build artifacts and logs

‚ùå Cannot deploy to production

‚ùå Cannot manage system settings

2. Security Boundary Testing
bash
# Attempted security boundary violations:
- Tester trying to access /configure page: ACCESS DENIED
- Developer trying to view credentials: ACCESS DENIED
- Non-admin modifying agent configuration: ACCESS DENIED
üéØ RBAC Benefits Demonstrated
1. Principle of Least Privilege
Each role has only necessary permissions

Reduces attack surface

Prevents accidental misconfigurations

2. Team Collaboration Security
Developers can build without risking production

Testers can validate without modifying code

Admins maintain system integrity

3. Audit and Compliance
Clear permission trails

Role-based activity monitoring

Simplified user management

‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Scenarios Mitigated
Scenario 1: Credential Exposure
Without RBAC: Developer accidentally exposes production database credentials in build script
With RBAC: Developers cannot access or view credential storage

Scenario 2: Unauthorized Deployment
Without RBAC: Tester accidentally triggers production deployment
With RBAC: Testers lack deployment permissions to production environments

Scenario 3: Malicious Code Injection
Without RBAC: Compromised developer account can modify all pipelines
With RBAC: Limited to development areas only

üìù Interview Questions & Answers
Q1: Why is RBAC essential in a CI/CD environment, and what are the consequences of weak access control?
Essential Reasons for RBAC in CI/CD:

Security Enforcement:

Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive credentials and production systems

Reduces risk of malicious code injection into deployment pipelines

Ensures only authorized personnel can modify critical infrastructure

Compliance Requirements:

Meets regulatory standards (SOX, HIPAA, GDPR)

Provides audit trails for change management

Demonstrates proper access controls during security audits

Operational Stability:

Prevents accidental configuration changes by inexperienced users

Reduces human error in production environments

Maintains pipeline integrity across teams

Consequences of Weak Access Control:

Security Breaches:

Exposed credentials leading to data theft

Unauthorized production deployments

Malicious code injection into build artifacts

Operational Disruptions:

Accidental deletion of critical jobs or configurations

Unauthorized agent modifications causing build failures

Inconsistent environment configurations

Compliance Failures:

Failed security audits

Regulatory penalties and fines

Loss of customer trust and reputation damage

Q2: Can you describe a scenario where inadequate RBAC could lead to security issues?
Scenario: Compromised Developer Credentials

Situation:
A developer's Jenkins credentials are phished through a social engineering attack. The organization has weak RBAC where all developers have full administrative access.

Timeline of Security Breach:

Initial Compromise (Day 1):

Attacker gains access to developer Jenkins account

Discovers the account has full administrative privileges

Reconnaissance Phase (Day 1-2):

Attacker explores all Jenkins projects and credentials

Identifies production deployment pipelines and sensitive credentials

Maps out the entire CI/CD infrastructure

Credential Harvesting (Day 2):

Accesses and exports all stored credentials (database passwords, API keys, cloud access tokens)

Discovers production AWS access keys with broad permissions

Backdoor Installation (Day 3):

Modifies critical build pipelines to include malicious code

Creates hidden jobs that exfiltrate build artifacts and source code

Sets up persistent access through scheduled malicious builds

Production Compromise (Day 4):

Uses stolen cloud credentials to access production infrastructure

Deploys cryptocurrency miners or ransomware

Accesses customer data from production databases

Cover-Up Actions (Day 5):

Modifies Jenkins logs to hide malicious activities

Creates fake user accounts to obscure the attack source

Sets up alert suppression to avoid detection

Impact:

Financial: Significant cloud cost overruns from resource abuse

Data: Customer data breach with regulatory implications

Operational: Production system instability and service outages

Reputational: Loss of customer trust and brand damage

RBAC Mitigation:
With proper RBAC, the damage would be limited to:

Only development environment access

No credential viewing permissions

No production deployment capabilities

Restricted job modification rights

üîß Best Practices Implemented
1. Role Design Principles
Separation of Duties: Different teams have distinct responsibilities

Least Privilege: Users get only necessary permissions

Regular Reviews: Periodic access right audits

2. Security Controls
Job-level Restrictions: Sensitive jobs have additional protection

Credential Segregation: Production credentials isolated from development

Build Authorization: Approval workflows for critical deployments

3. Monitoring and Auditing
Access Logging: All user actions recorded

Permission Changes: RBAC modifications tracked

Security Alerts: Suspicious activity notifications

‚úÖ Conclusion
The RBAC implementation successfully demonstrates:

Secure Multi-Team Collaboration: Different roles can work without compromising security

Controlled Access: Each user has appropriate permissions for their responsibilities

Risk Mitigation: Critical systems protected from unauthorized access

Compliance Ready: Audit-friendly permission structure

The matrix-based security approach provides granular control over Jenkins resources, ensuring that organizational security policies are enforced while maintaining operational efficiency across development, testing, and operations teams.

    }
}
2. Jenkins Replay Feature Utilization
Replay Pipeline for Debugging:

Access Replay: Go to failed build ‚Üí Click "Replay"

Modify Pipeline: Edit Jenkinsfile in browser

Test Fixes:

groovy
// Test different approaches in replay
stage('Debug Deployment') {
    steps {
        script {
            // Approach 1: Try with different image
            sh 'docker run --rm hello-world'
            
            // Approach 2: Check Docker connectivity
            sh 'docker info'
            
            // Approach 3: Test with simple container
            sh 'docker run --rm alpine echo "Docker is working"'
        }
    }
}
3. Conditional Debugging
Smart Debugging Implementation:

groovy
def DEBUG_MODE = params.DEBUG_MODE ?: false

pipeline {
    parameters {
        booleanParam(name: 'DEBUG_MODE', defaultValue: false, description: 'Enable verbose debugging')
    }
    
    stages {
        stage('Conditional Debug') {
            steps {
                script {
                    if (DEBUG_MODE) {
                        echo "üö® DEBUG MODE ENABLED - EXTENSIVE LOGGING ACTIVE"
                        
                        // Extensive debugging
                        sh '''
                        echo "=== COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM INFO ==="
                        uname -a
                        cat /etc/os-release
                        docker info
                        docker system info
                        echo "=== NETWORK INFO ==="
                        ip addr show
                        netstat -tulpn
                        '''
                    } else {
                        echo "üîß Normal mode - minimal logging"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
